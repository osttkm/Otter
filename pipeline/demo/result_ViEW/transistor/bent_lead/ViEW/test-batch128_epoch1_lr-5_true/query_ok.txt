bent_lead --> bent transistor

context1: OK, context2: NG, query: OK

<image>User: This is an image of transistor. Does this transistor have any defects such as bent transistor, cut transistor, damaged transistor, and misplaced transistor? GPT:<answer> No. This transistor does not have any defects such as bent transistor, cut transistor, damaged transistor, and misplaced transistor, so it is non-defective.<|endofchunk|><image>User: This is an image of transistor. Does this transistor have any defects such as bent transistor, cut transistor, damaged transistor, and misplaced transistor? GPT:<answer> Yes. This transistor has some bent transistor, so it is defective.<|endofchunk|><image>User: This is an image of transistor.
