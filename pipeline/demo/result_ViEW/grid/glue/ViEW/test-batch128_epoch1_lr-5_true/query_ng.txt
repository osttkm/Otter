glue --> contaminated metal grid

context1: OK, context2: NG, query: NG

<image>User: This is an image of metal grid. Does this metal grid have any defects such as bent metal grid, broken metal grid, and contaminated metal grid? GPT:<answer> No. This metal grid does not have any defects such as bent metal grid, broken metal grid, and contaminated metal grid, so it is non-defective.<|endofchunk|><image>User: This is an image of metal grid. Does this metal grid have any defects such as bent metal grid, broken metal grid, and contaminated metal grid? GPT:<answer> Yes. This metal grid has some contaminated metal grid, so it is defective.<|endofchunk|><image>User: This is an image of metal grid.
