Zippers are used to fasten clothing, bags, and other items. They are made of a series of interlocking teeth, or teeth, that run along a metal or plastic track. When the two parts of the zipper are pulled apart, the teeth on one side slide past those on the other side, creating an opening or closing the item. Defective zippers may have broken teeth, torn sliders, or damaged tracks, so they are non-functional and cannot perform their intended function.
