context1: OK, context2: NG, query: OK

<image>User: This is an image of metal grid. Does this metal grid have any defects such as bent metal grid, broken metal grid, and contaminated metal grid? GPT:<answer> No. This metal grid does not have any defects such as bent metal grid, broken metal grid, and contaminated metal grid, so it is non-defective.<|endofchunk|><image>User: This is an image of metal grid. Does this metal grid have any defects such as bent metal grid, broken metal grid, and contaminated metal grid? GPT:<answer> Yes. This metal grid has some contaminated metal grid, so it is defective.<|endofchunk|><image>User: This is an image of metal grid.

No. This meta grid has enough metal grid to satisfy your needs, so It Is Non-defected.

/home/dataset/mvtec/grid/test/good/002.png
No. This meta grid has enough metal grid to satisfy your needs and so, it is nondeficient.

/home/dataset/mvtec/grid/test/good/003.png
No. This meta grid has none of the defective properties such as bending, breaking, and contamination, so its non-Defective, so.

/home/dataset/mvtec/grid/test/good/004.png
No. This meta grid has enough metal grid to qualify it as non-Defectives.
